# e.circul.ar

This project presents your GMail in an advertising/circular fashion. Content delivery mechanisms such as this have designed for hundreds of years to much success. It's only been the last decade and the invent of Mailing Lists that we've decided to break this paradigm.

e.circul.ar attempts to parse your GMail, and present your ads and promotions in a full-color advertising circular format.
